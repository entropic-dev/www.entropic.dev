  <h1>the Entropic package manager</h1>
  <p>Entropic sure has a fast, sophisticated web site, doesn't it?</p>
  <p>Well, it's fast, anyway. You probably want to go to 
  <a href="https://github.com/entropic-dev/entropic">Github</a> and 
  read the source instead of this.</a>

  <p>Or maybe you'd like to <a href="https://github.com/entropic-dev/www.entropic.dev">make this website better</a>!</p>
